# GIT Commiter
Git commiter is a Cocoa app for commiting, pulling, and cleaning your commit. It's really easy to use, just a few clicks and you're commiting, pushing and whatever.
# TO DO
* Git console
* New icon (?)
* More interface love
* More functions
# WARNING
It may fail with some repos where when pushing asks for username and password. It's recommended to have public keys set up :)
